<p>This is a pastebin made by Yasoob Khalid as a side project.</p>
<p>I made it as a small project just to learn the skills required to make a pastebin and to learn a little about databases and user authentication.</p>
<p>This pastebin is OpenSource and the source code is available on <a href = 'https://github.com/yasoob/logit-bin'>GitHub</a>. This pastebin offers some unique options. Here are some of the features:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can choose to post anonymous pastes</li>
<li>Automatic focus on textarea so that you can quickly start typing</li>
<li>Automatic syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Showing diff between two pastes</li>
<li>Signup and keep track of your pastes</li>
<li>You can delete your paste anytime if you have signed up</li>
<li>Commenting system</li>
</ul>
